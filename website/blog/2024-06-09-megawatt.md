According to the [Solar Energy Industries Association](https://www.seia.org/initiatives/whats-megawatt) (SEIA):

> The current national average (through Q2 2022) of homes powered by a MW of solar is 173.

This varies by many factors. Louisiana averages less than 100 homes while California averages more than 250 homes per megawatt.
